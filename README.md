System for managing a customer database and their invoices with Angular

The project consists in the creation of a system for the management of a customer database and their invoices.

The APIs have restricted access, a login system and exchange of Beerer tokens is provided.

The customer database allows the classic crud operations, the modification entry form
is enriched by some APIs for provinces, municipalities and types of customer.

As far as the list of customers is concerned, the API provides server-side pagination
Same thing for the "invoices" system: the classic crud implementations are foreseen.

Framework used: 
- Bootstrap, 
- NGBootstrap

### Terminal commands:
- `npm i`;
